- declare dependencies. need http, ffmpeg, imagemagick(convert).
	- will also need to determine progress (progress bar).
	- will probably need some kind of fs support (for a name, and to show the size of the image created).
	- will probably need to be able to upload files.

it will need something that will handle http requests. It will need something that can decide what to do with a post.
